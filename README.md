## Replicate our simulations and recreate our figures
This GitHub repository contains the code and data needed to replicate the computational experiments and recreate all figures for Araujo et al. (2022). Note that this experiment was run using high performance computing and cannot easily be replicated on a personal computer.

*Note: All filepaths in the code files provided should be modified to reflect current individual data and information locations. Only bootstrapped realization is provided due to memory constraints. Please contact the corresponding author at bruna.mattos.araujo@gmail.com for full set of realizations.*
