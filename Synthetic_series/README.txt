This directory has all codes necessary to generate synthetic series needed as input for building States of the World (SOW) in WaterPaths.
In each DU Pathways steps (DU-reevaluation and Optimization), synthetic series of demand, evaporation, natural inflow and Deep Uncertainties 
must be generated. Thus, in each folder (DU-reevaluation and Optimization), there are subfolders with codes and data related to each type of
synthetic serie to be generated (demand, hidroclimatic - inflow and evaporation, and deep uncertainty). Further intructions are
given in each specific directory.
For FDB Study Case, 1,000 40-year-long SOWs were generated, and thus 1,000 series of each kind of data were built. Due to memory limitations,
we're providing a subset of all series, so users can verify their results from their own synthetic generation.
